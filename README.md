# NBitcoin.Dash

This project allows NBitcoin to support Dash.

To register Dash extensions, run:

```
NBitcoin.Dash.DashNetworks.Register();
```

Or just start to use NBitcoin with `NBitcoin.Dash.DashNetworks.Mainnet` or `NBitcoin.Dash.DashNetworks.Testnet` and networks will be registered at first use. 

You can then start using Dash in the same way you do with Bitcoin.
